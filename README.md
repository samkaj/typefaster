# Type faster! 

This is a quick project I made to get familiar with go and web servers. The design is **HEAVILY** inspired by [typings.gg](https://github.com/briano1905/typings), and all that credit goes to [@briano1905](https://github.com/briano1905).  

## Prerequisites

You need [Go](https://go.dev/) installed. This project was written in `Go 1.18.`.

## Installation and running

To be run the project, you need to do the following in your favorite terminal:

```console
cd <path/to/typefaster>
go mod tidy
go run .
```
